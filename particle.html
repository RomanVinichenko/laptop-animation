                        User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces
                        in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers
                        aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI
                        design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms—e.g.,
                        voice-controlled interfaces.

                    <p class="particle-content__text">
                        Often confused with UX design, UI design is more concerned with the surface
                        and overall feel of a design. UI design is a craft where you the designer
                        build an essential part of the user experience. UX design covers the entire
                        spectrum of the user experience. One analogy is to picture UX design as a
                        car with UI design as the driving console.

                        User Interface (UI) Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to
                        do and ensuring that the interface has elements that are easy to access,
                        understand, and use to facilitate those actions. UI brings together concepts
                        from interaction design, visual design, and information architecture.

                    <p class="particle-content__text">
                        Users have become familiar with interface elements acting in a certain way,
                        so try to be consistent and predictable in your choices and their layout.
                        Doing so will help with task completion, efficiency, and satisfaction.

                        Interface elements include but are not limited to:

                            Input Controls: buttons, text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons,
                            dropdown lists, list boxes, toggles, date field.
                        </li>

                            Navigational Components: breadcrumb, slider, search field, pagination,
                            slider, tags, icons
                        </li>

                        There are times when multiple elements might be appropriate for displaying
                        content. When this happens, it’s important to consider the trade-offs. For
                        example, sometimes elements that can help save you space, put more of a
                        burden on the user mentally by forcing them to guess what is within the
                        dropdown or what the element might be.
