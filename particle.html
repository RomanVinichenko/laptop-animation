            <p class="particle-content__meaning">User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other formsâ€”e.g., voice-controlled interfaces.</p>
        <h1 class="particle-content__title">Designing User Interfaces for Users</h1>
        <p class="particle-content__text">Often confused with UX design, UI design is more concerned with the surface and overall feel of a design. UI design is a craft where you the designer build an essential part of the user experience. UX design covers the entire spectrum of the user experience. One analogy is to picture UX design as a car with UI design as the driving console.
